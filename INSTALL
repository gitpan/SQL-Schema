1) Requirements

This module currently only works with an Oracle database.
It has been tested with Oracle 8i on Linux should also work
with Oracle 8.0.x on other platforms.
The module requires DBI.

Last but not least: To perform the tests, you do need a
blank database user (a database user not owning any database
object like table, view, package, ...).


2) Installation

Before installation you have to set three environment variables as
follows:
  DBI_DATA_SOURCE='dbi:Oracle(LongReadLen=>65536):hobbit'
  DBI_USERNAME='frodo'
  DBI_AUTH='bilbo'
  export DBI_DATA_SOURCE DBI_USERNAME DBI_AUTH
They are only required if you want to test the packages prior to
installation. These three enivronment variables correspond to the
first three arguments for DBI's connect() method.

THE GIVEN DATABASE USER NEEDS TO BE BLANK. This means: For the tests
to succeed you have to name a user not owning any database object
(neither table, nor view, nor package, ...).

The rest of the installation process for this perl module is
straight forward as with most of the perl modules using
ExtUtils::MakeMaker. The following command sequence is sufficient:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install


3) Usage

After installation the script `export_schema' should be available.
Depending on your system the man page export_schema(1) or the command
  perldoc export_schema
shows you more details about its usage.
