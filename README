NAME
    SQL::Schema - Convert a data dictionary into SQL statements

SYNOPSIS
      use DBI;

      my $dbh = DBI->connect(...);

      use SQL::Schema;

      my $schema = SQL::Schema->new($dbh);

      my $sql = $schema->string;
      print $sql;

      print "$schema";

WARNING
    This is alpha software. It currently works with Oracle databases
    only. The name of the module might be changed in future releases
    as well as its interface.

    If somebody is modifying the datase schema during the life time
    of an `SQL::Schema' object, the object will probably fail and /
    or produce wrong information.

DESCRIPTION
    `SQL::Schema' is a class for objects representing a database
    schema. The methods of an instanciated object do allow to access
    the information within a database's data dictionary and to
    represent them as SQL create statements and the like using the
    proper SQL dialect.

  Constructor

      $schema = SQL::Schema->new($dbh);

    The new method instanciates a schema object. The only argument
    required is a database handle, which has to offer the same API
    as described within the DBI(3) manpage.

  Methods

      $sql = $schema->string;

    Returns an SQL string containing several statements at once.
    This string contains all the SQL statements to create the
    database schema.

    This method is overloaded with the string operator. So the
    following two lines are equivalent:

      $sql = $schema->string;
      $sql = "$schema";
